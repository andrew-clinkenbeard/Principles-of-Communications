11.3-see graphs

11.4- rectangular pulse-5
hamming pulse-30
sinc pulse- 3

12.1-
a. values of mu 1>mu>=.0008
b. the other sigals had better convergent values of tau


12.2
	ssrc works much better than a regtangular pulse
12.3
	it increases the timing of the tau value
	it changes the final converged value slightly
